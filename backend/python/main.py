        # Introduction to Deep Learning
        
        Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
        These neural networks are designed to mimic the human brain's structure and function.
        
        ## Key Concepts
        
        - Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain
        - Layers: Building blocks of neural networks that transform input data
        - Activation Functions: Functions that determine the output of a neural network node
        - Backpropagation: Algorithm for training neural networks by adjusting weights
        
        ## Applications
        
        Deep learning is used in various fields including:
        - Computer Vision: Image recognition, object detection, and image generation
        - Natural Language Processing: Language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation
        - Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language to text
        - Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars and drones
        - Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery
        - Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading
        
        ## Training Process
        
        Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation:
        1. Forward pass: Data flows through the network to produce an output
        2. Error calculation: The difference between the output and expected result is measured
        3. Backward pass: The error is propagated back through the network
        4. Weight adjustment: Connection weights are updated to minimize the error
        5. Iteration: The process repeats with new training examples
        
        ## Types of Neural Networks
        
        - Feedforward Neural Networks: Basic architecture where data flows in one direction
        - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for processing grid-like data (images)
        - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Process sequential data with memory of previous inputs
        - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Advanced RNN that can learn long-term dependencies
        - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Two networks compete to generate realistic data
